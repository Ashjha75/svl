            The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines Politically Exposed
            Person (PEP) as: individuals who are or have been entrusted with
            prominent public functions in a foreign country. Example: Heads of
            State or of government, senior politicians, senior government or
            executive council of governments, judicial, military officials,
            senior executives of state owned corporation, important politically
            party officials, ambassadors, attaches. Business relationships with
            family members or close associates of PEPs involve reputational
            risks similar to those with PEP themselves.
